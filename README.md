This is a website made because I couldn't find website that let you generate QR codes for free (at least that I liked) and wanted to get more React experience.

Its made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [QR code styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling)

There are a few more things I may tackle at some point in the future:

- Option for svg borders
- More QR code types
- More gradient options than what the current library offers
